Handsome, charismatic, genius&#8212;his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem&#58; Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse. Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control&#58; staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question&#58; Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through? Casey McQuiston's Red, White & Royal Blue proves&#58; true love isn't always diplomatic. \"I took this with me wherever I went and stole every second I had to read! Absorbing, hilarious, tender, sexy&#8212;this book had everything I crave. I&#8217;m jealous of all the readers out there who still get to experience Red, White & Royal Blue for the first time!\" - Christina Lauren, New York Times bestselling author of The Unhoneymooners\"Red, White & Royal Blue is outrageously fun.

Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters&rsquo; trip away&mdash;with visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she&rsquo;s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they&rsquo;ve met many times and it&rsquo;s never been cute. If Nora knows she&rsquo;s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again&mdash;in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow&mdash;what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they&rsquo;ve written about themselves.",

In the ballrooms and drawing rooms of Regency London, rules abound. From their earliest days, children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a prince&#8212;while other dictates of the ton are unspoken yet universally understood. A proper duke should be imperious and aloof. A young, marriageable lady should be amiable&#8230;but not too amiable.Daphne Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in her close-knit family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible young men in London. Everyone likes Daphne for her kindness and wit. But no one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for that, too unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen.Amiability is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently returned to England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and society&#8212;just as his callous father shunned Simon throughout his painful childhood. Yet an encounter with his best friend&#8217;s sister offers another option. If Daphne agrees to a fake courtship, Simon can deter the mamas who parade their daughters before him. Daphne, meanwhile, will see her prospects and her reputation soar.The plan works like a charm&#8212;at first. But amid the glittering, gossipy, cut-throat world of London&#8217;s elite, there is only one certainty&#58; love ignores every rule...This novel includes the 2nd epilogue, a peek at the story after the story.

Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming... Nora Stephens' life is books-she's read them all-and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters' trip away-with visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she's convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they've met many times and it's never been cute. If Nora knows she's not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he's nobody's hero, but as they are thrown together again and again-in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow-what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they've written about themselves.",

Thermodynamics-the branch of physics that deals with energy and entropy-governs everything from the behavior of living cells to the black hole at the center of our galaxy. Not only that, but thermodynamics explains why we must eat and breathe, how lights turn on, the limits of computing, and how the universe will end. The brilliant people who decoded its laws came from every branch of the sciences; they were engineers, physicists, chemists, biologists, cosmologists, and mathematicians. From French military engineer and physicist Sadi Carnot to Lord Kelvin, James Joule, Albert Einstein, Emmy Noether, Alan Turing, and Stephen Hawking, author Paul Sen introduces us to all of the players who passed the baton of scientific progress through time and across nations. Incredibly driven and idealistic, these brave pioneers performed groundbreaking work often in the face of torment and tragedy. Their discoveries helped create the modern world and transformed every branch of science, from biology to cosmology. “Elegantly written and engaging” (Financial Times), Einstein's Fridge brings to life one of the most important scientific revolutions of all time and captures the thrill of discovery and the power of scientific progress to shape the course of history.",

Named a Most Anticipated Book of the Year by Time, Entertainment Weekly, Vogue, Good Housekeeping, Oprah Daily, Glamour, USA TODAY, Parade, Bustle, San Francisco Chronicle, The Seattle Times, The Boston Globe, Tampa Bay Times, BuzzFeed, and Vulture “A compelling read that showcases Egan's masterful storytelling.” -Time “Dazzling.” -Vogue “Radiant, exhilarating.” -Slate “Mesmerizing¿A thought-provoking examination of how and why we change.” -People From one of the most celebrated writers of our time comes an “inventive, effervescent” (Oprah Daily) novel about the memory and quest for authenticity and human connection.<I>The Candy House opens with the staggeringly brilliant Bix Bouton, whose company, Mandala, is so successful that he is “one of those tech demi-gods with whom we're all on a first name basis.” Bix is forty, with four kids, restless, and desperate for a new idea, when he stumbles into a conversation group, mostly Columbia professors, one of whom is experimenting with downloading or “externalizing” memory. Within a decade, Bix's new technology, “Own Your Unconscious”-which allows you access to every memory you've ever had, and to share your memories in exchange for access to the memories of others-has seduced multitudes. In the world of Egan's spectacular imagination, there are “counters” who track and exploit desires and there are “eluders,” those who understand the price of taking a bite of the Candy House. Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of narrative styles-from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter, and a chapter of tweets. Intellectually dazzling, <I>The Candy House is also a moving testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for connection, family, privacy, and love. “A beautiful exploration of loss, memory, and history” (<I>San Francisco Chronicle), “this is minimalist maximalism. It's as if Egan compressed a big 19th-century novel onto a flash drive” (<I>The New York Times).",

        "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ¿ John Grisham is the acknowledged master of the legal thriller. In his first collection of novellas, law is a common thread, but America's favorite storyteller has several surprises in store. “Homecoming” takes us back to Ford County, the fictional setting of many of John Grisham's unforgettable stories. Jake Brigance is back, but he's not in the courtroom. He's called upon to help an old friend, Mack Stafford, a former lawyer in Clanton, who three years earlier became a local legend when he stole money from his clients, divorced his wife, filed for bankruptcy, and left his family in the middle of the night, never to be heard from again-until now. Now Mack is back, and he's leaning on his old pals, Jake and Harry Rex, to help him return. His homecoming does not go as planned.In “Strawberry Moon,” we meet Cody Wallace, a young death row inmate only three hours away from execution. His lawyers can't save him, the courts slam the door, and the governor says no to a last-minute request for clemency. As the clock winds down, Cody has one final request. The “Sparring Partners” are the Malloy brothers, Kirk and Rusty, two successful young lawyers who inherited a once prosperous firm when its founder, their father, was sent to prison. Kirk and Rusty loathe each other, and speak to each other only when necessary. As the firm disintegrates, the resulting fiasco falls into the lap of Diantha Bradshaw, the only person the partners trust. Can she save the Malloys, or does she take a stand for the first time in her career and try to save herself?By turns suspenseful, hilarious, powerful, and moving, these are three of the greatest stories John Grisham has ever told.",

But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn's Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn's life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn's story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. Written with Reid's signature talent for \"creating complex, likable characters\" (Real Simple), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.",

Raised in a secluded island mansion deep in the woods and kept isolated by her true crime-obsessed parents, she is unable to move beyond the disappearance of her twin brother, Andy, when they were sixteen. After several years away and following her father's death, Dahlia returns to the house, where the family makes a gruesome discovery: buried in their father's plot is another body-Andy's, his skull split open with an ax. Dahlia is quick to blame Andy's murder on the serial killer who terrorized the island for decades, while the rest of her family reacts to the revelation in unsettling ways. Her brother, Charlie, pours his energy into creating a family memorial museum, highlighting their research into the lives of famous murder victims; her sister, Tate, forges ahead with her popular dioramas portraying crime scenes; and their mother affects a cheerfully domestic facade, becoming unrecognizable as the woman who performed murder reenactments for her children.

Davenport next generation has arrived and Letty is exactly the kind of cool-eyed, smart-mouthed, lethally dangerous heroine we've been waiting for.” --Lisa Gardner, author of One Step Too FarBy age twenty-four, Letty Davenport has seen more action and uncovered more secrets than many law enforcement professionals. Now a recent Stanford grad with a master's in economics, she's restless and bored in a desk job for U.S. Senator Colles. Letty's ready to quit, but her skills have impressed Colles, and he offers her a carrot: feet-on-the-ground investigative work, in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security.  Several oil companies in Texas have reported thefts of crude, Colles tells her.  He isn't so much concerned with the oil as he is with the money: who is selling the oil, and what are they doing with the profits? Rumor has it that a fairly ugly militia group might be involved. Colles wants to know if the money is going to them, and if so, what they're planning.  Letty is partnered with a DHS investigator, John Kaiser, and they head to Texas.  When the case quicky turns deadly, they know they're on the track of something bigger.  The militia group has set in motion an explosive plan . . . and the clock is ticking down.",

But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn's Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn's life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn's story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. Written with Reid's signature talent for \"creating complex, likable characters\" (Real Simple), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.",

But while they were able to work together initially, formalizing an agreement in 1801, relations between them rapidly deteriorated. In 1809, Napoleon ordered the Pope's arrest.Ambrogio Caiani provides a pioneering account of the tempestuous relationship between the emperor and his most unyielding opponent. Drawing on original findings in the Vatican and other European archives, Caiani uncovers the nature of Catholic resistance against Napoleon's empire; charts Napoleon's approach to Papal power; and reveals how the Emperor attempted to subjugate the church to his vision of modernity. Gripping and vivid, this book shows the struggle for supremacy between two great individuals-and sheds new light on the conflict that would shape relations between the Catholic church and the modern state for centuries to come.",

        "description": "<B>Pro wrestler and political commentator Tyrus goes deep into his wild but triumphant life story, from his painfully dysfunctional upbringing to bodyguarding for Snoop Dogg, to becoming a wrestling icon and one of the most provocative on-air voices today.The product of a 1970s mixed marriage, George Murdoch learned to fight early in life, fending off both race-baiting bullies and the demons of a dysfunctional home. Couch surfing all through high school and most of college, the quick-witted, sharp-tongued giant played football, ran drugs, and bounced at clubs to try to survive. After a false start with the WWE, he eventually became Snoop Dogg's bodyguard and traveled the world with the hip hop legend, biding his time and honing his rap. When the WWE urged him to return, George became \"Brodus Clay\" and, for the next several years, reinvented himself numerous times under the watchful mentorship of the legendary Dusty Rhodes, \"the American Dream.\" He was eventually christened \"Tyrus,\" and shortly after, a chance social media encounter with Greg Gutfeld at Fox News resulted in Tyrus finding a new skill: sage social commentator. Ferociously funny, blunt, and tenacious, <I>Just Tyrus traces his unlikely and spectacular rise. As always with Tyrus, it's in-your-face and offers no apologies.",

        "description": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER NAMED A BEST BOOK OF 2021 BY NPR ¿¿“To read Maggie Smith is to embrace the achingly precious beauty of the present moment.” -Time “A captivating collection from a wise, accessible poet.” -People From the award-winning poet and bestselling author of Keep Moving and Good Bones, a stunning poetry collection that celebrates the beauty and messiness of life.With her breakout bestseller Keep Moving, Maggie Smith captured the nation with her “meditations on kindness and hope” (NPR). Now, with Goldenrod, the award-winning poet returns with a powerful collection of poems that look at parenthood, solitude, love, and memory. Pulling objects from everyday life-a hallway mirror, a rock found in her son's pocket, a field of goldenrods at the side of the road-she reveals the magic of the present moment. Only Maggie Smith could turn an autocorrect mistake into a line of poetry, musing that her phone “doesn't observe / the high holidays, autocorrecting / shana tova to shaman tobacco, / Rosh Hashanah to rose has hands.”¿ Slate called Smith's “superpower as a writer” her “ability to find the perfect concrete metaphor for inchoate human emotions and explore it with empathy and honesty.” The poems in Goldenrod celebrate the contours of daily life, explore and delight in the space between thought and experience, and remind us that we decide what is beautiful.",

James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.Learn how to:Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;Design your environment to make success easier;Get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits—whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif(typeof performance.mark !== 'undefined')\nperformance.mark(\"Product_Tabs_loading_start\");\n\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Starts -->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10391,Starts-->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10391,Ends-->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Ends-->\n\n\nRelated collections and offers\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nFor Your TBL (To Be Listened) List\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nTop Selling Audiobooks\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nThe Best Books to Listen to Now\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nBuy One, Get One 50% Off Audiobooks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nli hidden>\nProduct Details\nRelated Subjects\nRead an Excerpt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\n\nFrom the Publisher\nWall Street Journal bestsellerUSA Today bestsellerPublisher's Weekly bestsellerOne of Fast Company's 7 Best Business Books of 2018One of Business Insider's Best Self-Help Books of 2018\"A supremely practical and useful book.

Now, she's passionate about her work, but that's the only passion in her life. “Never love something that can't love you back,” is advice her father-in-law gives her, but Hattie doesn't follow it and falls head-over-heels for a money pit of a house. She's determined to make it work, but disaster after disaster occurs, and Hattie's dream might cost Kavanaugh & Son their livelihood. Hattie needs money, and fast. When a slick Hollywood producer shows up in her hometown of Savannah, Georgia, she gets a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: star in a beach house renovation reality show called The Homewreckers, cast against a male lead who may be a love interest, or may be the ultimate antagonist. Soon, there's more at stake than bad pipes and dry rot: during the demolition, evidence comes to light that points to the mysterious disappearance of a young wife and mother years before.With a burned out detective investigating the case, an arsonist on the loose, two men playing with her emotions, and layers upon layers of vintage wallpaper causing havoc, it's a question of who will flip, who will flop, and if Hattie will ever get her happily-ever-after.",

Imagine a company as a bus filled with people who either help or hinder a team's ability to move it forward: drivers (who steer the organization), runners (who consistently go above and beyond for the good of the organization), joggers (who do their jobs without pushing themselves), walkers (who are just getting pulled along), and riders (who hinder success and drag the team down). It's the team leader's job to recognize how members fall into these categories, encourage them to keep the \"bus\" moving by working together, and know when it's time to kick the riders off. In the tradition of <I>Who Moved My Cheese? and <I>Fish!, <I>Move Your Bus is an accessible and uplifting business parable that illustrates Clark's expert strategies to maximize the performance of each member of a team. These easy to implement techniques will inspire employees and team leaders alike to work harder and smarter and drive the organization to succeed.",

And maybe something as small as a warm donut is powerful enough to break a curse as vast as the California coastline.As the lives of these three women become entangled by chance and fate, a story of magic, identity, curses, and hope begins, and a family worth crossing the universe for is found.A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books.",

        "description": "The last of John Steinbeck's play-novelettes, Burning Bright was the author's final attempt after 1937's Of Mice and Men and 1942's The Moon is Down to create what he saw as a new, experimental literary form.  Four scenes, four people: the husband who yearns for a son, ignorant of his own sterility; the wife who commits adultery to fulfill her husband's wish; the father of the child; and the outsider whose actions will affect them all. In this turn on a medieval morality play, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck casts an unwavering light on these four intertwined lives, revealing in their finely drawn circumstances the universal contours of vulnerability and passion, desperation and desire. This edition features an introduction and notes for further reading by Steinbeck scholar John Ditsky.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif(typeof performance.mark !== 'undefined')\nperformance.mark(\"Product_Tabs_loading_start\");\n\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Starts -->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10391,Starts-->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10391,Ends-->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Ends-->\n\n\nRelated collections and offers\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nLimited Time Audiobook Deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nli hidden>\nProduct Details\nRelated Subjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\n\nFrom the Publisher\nBy the Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature&ldquo;A morality play conceived with poetic intensity.&rdquo; &mdash;New York Herald Tribune &#160; &ldquo;[Burning Bright&rsquo;s] four solitary characters are neither flesh-and-blood nor stock figures; husband, wife, friend, outsider, they are the legendary archetypes of folklore, speaking a spare, bare-boned language salted with color&mdash;a kind of abstract folk speech that is stilted, poetic and moving.&rdquo; &mdash;The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\n\n<!-- changes start for ATG-9471 -->\n\nBN ID:\n<!-- changes End for ATG-9471 -->\n2940169467635\n\n\nPublisher:\n\nPenguin Random House\n\n\n Publication date:\n03/12/2022\n\nSeries:\n\nPenguin Audio Classics\n\nEdition description:\nUnabridged\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Subjects\n\n\n20th Century American Fiction - 1945-2000\n\nAdultery & Infidelity - Fiction\n\nAmerican Fiction & Literature Classics\n\nBooks by Nobel Prize in Literature Laureates->1961-1970\n\nLiterary Fiction\n\nMarriage - Fiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n\nVideos\n\n<!-- -->\n<!-- CAP TITLE LENGTH -->\n\n<!-- \n -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- \n -->\n<!-- -->\n\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif(typeof performance.mark !== 'undefined' && typeof performance.measure !== 'undefined')\n{\nperformance.mark(\"Product_Tabs_loading_end\");\nperformance.measure(\n\"productTabsDur\",\n\"Product_Tabs_loading_start\",\n\"Product_Tabs_loading_end\"\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nBy the Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature&ldquo;A morality play conceived with poetic intensity.&rdquo; &mdash;New York Herald Tribune &#160; &ldquo;[Burning Bright&rsquo;s] four solitary characters are neither flesh-and-blood nor stock figures; husband, wife, friend, outsider, they are the legendary archetypes of folklore, speaking a spare, bare-boned language salted with color&mdash;a kind of abstract folk speech that is stilted, poetic and moving.&rdquo; &mdash;The New York Times\nFrom the Publisher\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Gigya Changes -->\n<!-- Gigya Changes -->\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscript defer>\n$(function() {\nvar isLoggedIn = false;\nvar ratingsParams = {\ncategoryID: 'Products',\nstreamID: '1002937563', /* use Product ID for unique identifier?

She can&#8217;t imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that.

This is the path I took to finding my purpose but also my voice in a world that didn't always see me.As I wrote Finding Me, my eyes were open to the truth of how our stories are often not given close examination. We are forced to reinvent them to fit into a crazy, competitive, judgmental world. So I wrote this for anyone running through life untethered, desperate and clawing their way through murky memories, trying to get to some form of self-love. For anyone who needs reminding that a life worth living can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you.Finding Me is a deep reflection, a promise, and a love letter of sorts to self. My hope is that my story will inspire you to light up your own life with creative expression and rediscover who you were before the world put a label on you.",

He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal-an experience that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe.A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.",

This is the path I took to finding my purpose but also my voice in a world that didn't always see me.As I wrote Finding Me, my eyes were open to the truth of how our stories are often not given close examination. We are forced to reinvent them to fit into a crazy, competitive, judgmental world. So I wrote this for anyone running through life untethered, desperate and clawing their way through murky memories, trying to get to some form of self-love. For anyone who needs reminding that a life worth living can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you.Finding Me is a deep reflection, a promise, and a love letter of sorts to self. My hope is that my story will inspire you to light up your own life with creative expression and rediscover who you were before the world put a label on you.",

That she got into Sinegard&#8212;the most elite military school in Nikan&#8212;was even more surprising.But surprises aren&#8217;t always good.Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard.

There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn't want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis.In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King's most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low-grade — but escalating — battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott's lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face — including his own — he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott's affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others.From Stephen King, our “most precious renewable resource, like Shakespeare in the malleability of his work” (The Guardian), Elevation is an antidote to our divisive culture, as gloriously joyful (with a twinge of deep sadness) as It's a Wonderful Life.",

The estranged daughter of a notorious and powerful mobster, she has defied the odds to follow her dream. On a routine patrol, Philomena responds to a domestic violence call and rescues a bloodied young woman, Tempe Brown, who is the mistress of a decorated and intimidating London detective, Darren Goodall. The incident is hushed up by the police to protect Goodall's reputation, but Philomena has now made a dangerous enemy who is afraid of no one. Philomena and Tempe strike up a tentative friendship, determined to protect each other from Goodall, but something isn't quite right about the stories Tempe tells and the secrets she keeps. Yet the young officer is drawn into Tempe's world, unsure of what is real or invented. After a bungled break-in and an unsolved murder, Philomena finds herself trapped-with her career, her impending wedding, and her very survival in doubt. Robotham's brilliant ability to render complex characters, both good and bad, keeps readers sympathetic, yet unsure of whom to trust, “maintain[ing] an air of excruciating suspense” (<I>The <I>Washington Post)-until the very last page.",

        "name": "Lincoln in the Bardo: A Novel",
        "description": "The long-awaited first novel from the author of Tenth of December: a moving and original father-son story featuring none other than Abraham Lincoln, as well as an unforgettable cast of supporting characters, living and dead, historical and inventedFebruary 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. \"My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,\" the president says at the time. \"God has called him home.\" Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy's body.From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state-called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo-a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul.Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction's ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?The 166-person full cast features award-winning actors and musicians, as well as a number of Saunders' family, friends, and members of his publishing team, including, in order of their appearance:   Nick Offerman as HANS VOLLMAN David Sedaris as ROGER BEVINS III Carrie Brownstein as ISABELLE PERKINS George Saunders as THE REVEREND EVERLY THOMAS Miranda July as MRS. ELIZABETH CRAWFORD Lena Dunham as ELISE TRAYNOR Ben Stiller as JACK MANDERS Julianne Moore as JANE ELLIS Susan Sarandon as MRS. ABIGAIL BLASS Bradley Whitford as LT. CECIL STONE Bill Hader as EDDIE BARON Megan Mullally as BETSY BARON Rainn Wilson as PERCIVAL \"DASH\" COLLIER Jeff Tweedy as CAPTAIN WILLIAM PRINCE Kat Dennings as MISS TAMARA DOOLITTLE Jeffrey Tambor as PROFESSOR EDMUND BLOOMER Mike O'Brien as LAWRENCE T. DECROIX Keegan-Michael Key as ELSON FARWELL Don Cheadle as THOMAS HAVENS and Patrick Wilson as STANLEY \"PERFESSER\" LIPPERT with Kirby Heyborne as WILLIE LINCOLN, Mary Karr as MRS. ROSE MILLAND, and Cassandra Campbell as Your NarratorPraise for the audiobook\"Lincoln in the Bardo\" sets a new standard for cast recordings in its structure, in its performances, and in its boldness. Now, let's see who answers the challenge.\" - Chicago Tribune   \"Like the novel, the audiobook breaks new ground in what can be accomplished through a story. It helps that there's not a single bad note in the cast of a whopping 166 people. It's also the rare phenomenon of an audiobook being a completely different experience compared to the novel. Even if you've read the novel, the audiobook is worth a listen (and vice versa). The whole project pushes the narrative form forward.\" - A.V. Club   \"The result is an auditory experience unlike any other, where the awareness of individual voices disappears while the carefully calibrated soundscape summons a metaphysical masterpiece. This is a tour de force of audiobook production, and a dazzling realization of Saunders' unique authorial structure.”-Booklist“The finished audiobook's tapestry of voices perfectly mirrors the novel.”-Entertainment WeeklyPraise for George Saunders“No one writes more powerfully than George Saunders about the lost, the unlucky, the disenfranchised.”-Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times“Saunders makes you feel as though you are reading fiction for the first time.”-Khaled Hosseini“Few people cut as hard or deep as Saunders does.”-Junot Díaz“George Saunders is a complete original. There is no one better, no one more essential to our national sense of self and sanity.”-Dave Eggers“Not since Twain has America produced a satirist this funny.”-Zadie Smith“There is no one like him. He is an original-but everyone knows that.”-Lorrie Moore“George Saunders makes the all-but-impossible look effortless. We're lucky to have him.”-Jonathan Franzen“An astoundingly tuned voice-graceful, dark, authentic, and funny-telling just the kinds of stories we need to get us through these times.”-Thomas Pynchon",

Combining an historian&#8217;s rigor with a food enthusiast&#8217;s palate, Paul Freedman&#8217;s seminal and highly entertaining Ten Restaurants That Changed America reveals how the history of our restaurants reflects nothing less than the history of America itself. Whether charting the rise of our love affair with Chinese food through San Francisco&#8217;s fabled Mandarin; evoking the poignant nostalgia of Howard Johnson&#8217;s, the beloved roadside chain that foreshadowed the pandemic of McDonald&#8217;s; or chronicling the convivial lunchtime crowd at Schrafft&#8217;s, the first dining establishment to cater to women&#8217;s tastes, Freedman uses each restaurant to reveal a wider story of race and class, immigration and assimilation. &#8220;As much about the contradictions and contrasts in this country as it is about its places to eat&#8221; (The New Yorker), Ten Restaurants That Changed America is a &#8220;must-read&#8221; (Eater) that proves &#8220;essential for anyone who cares about where they go to dinner&#8221; (Wall Street Journal Magazine).",

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<P>It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain&#58; mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.<P>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<P>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings.

While the sun is still hot, I die!\"<P>&#8212;Collected on the fifth day of the week Chach of the month Betab of the year 1171, ten seconds before death. Subject was a darkeyed soldier thirty-one years of age. Sample is considered questionable.<P>FIVE YEARS LATER<P>\"I'm going to die, aren't I?\" Cenn asked.<P>The weathered veteran beside Cenn turned and inspected him. The veteran wore a full beard, cut short. At the sides, the black hairs were starting to give way to grey.<P><I>I'm going to die, Cenn thought, clutching his spear&#8212;the shaft slick with sweat. <I>I'm going to die. Oh, Stormfather. I'm going to die....<P>\"How old are you, son?\" the veteran asked. Cenn didn't remember the man's name. It was hard to recall anything while watching that other army form lines across the rocky battlefield. That lining up seemed so civil. Neat, organized. Shortspears in the front ranks, longspears and javelins next, archers at the sides. The darkeyed spearmen wore equipment like Cenn's&#58; leather jerkin and knee-length skirt with a simple steel cap and a matching breastplate.<P>Many of the lighteyes had full suits of armor. They sat astride horses, their honor guards clustering around them with breastplates that gleamed burgundy and deep forest green. Were there Shardbearers among them? Brightlord Amaram wasn't a Shardbearer. Were any of his men? What if Cenn had to fight one? Ordinary men didn't kill Shardbearers. It had happened so infrequently that each occurrence was now legendary.<P><I>It's really happening, he thought with mounting terror. This wasn't a drill in the camp. This wasn't training out in the fields, swinging sticks. This was <I>real. Facing that fact&#8212;his heart pounding like a frightened animal in his chest, his legs unsteady&#8212;Cenn suddenly realized that he was a coward. He shouldn't have left the herds! He should never have&#8212;<P>\"Son?\" the veteran said, voice firm. \"How old are you?\"<P>\"Fifteen, sir.\"<P>\"And what's your name?\"<P>\"Cenn, sir.\"<P>The mountainous, bearded man nodded. \"I'm Dallet.\"<P>\"Dallet,\" Cenn repeated, still staring out at the other army. There were so many of them! Thousands. \"I'm going to die, aren't I?\"<P>\"<I>No.\" Dallet had a gruff voice, but somehow that was comforting. \"You're going to be just fine. Keep your head on straight.<P>Stay with the squad.\"<P>\"But I've barely had three months' training!\" He swore he could hear faint clangs from the enemy's armor or shields. \"I can barely hold this spear! Stormfather, I'm <I>dead. I can't&#8212;\"<P>\"Son,\" Dallet interrupted, soft but firm. He raised a hand and placed it on Cenn's shoulder. The rim of Dallet's large round shield reflected the light from where it hung on his back. \"You are <I>going to be <I>fine.\"<P>\"How can you know?\" It came out as a plea.<P>\"Because, lad. You're in Kaladin Stormblessed's squad.\" The other soldiers nearby nodded in agreement.<P>Behind them, waves and waves of soldiers were lining up&#8212;thousands of them. Cenn was right at the front, with Kaladin's squad of about thirty other men. Why had Cenn been moved to a new squad at the last moment? It had something to do with camp politics.<P>Why was this squad at the very front, where casualties were bound to be the greatest? Small fearspren&#8212;like globs of purplish goo&#8212;began to climb up out of the ground and gather around his feet. In a moment of sheer panic, he nearly dropped his spear and scrambled away. Dallet's hand tightened on his shoulder. Looking up into Dallet's confident black eyes, Cenn hesitated.<P>\"Did you piss before we formed ranks?\" Dallet asked.<P>\"I didn't have time to&#8212;\"<P>\"Go now.\"<P>\"<I>Here?\"<P>\"If you don't, you'll end up with it running down your leg in battle, distracting you, maybe killing you. Do it.\"<P>Embarrassed, Cenn handed Dallet his spear and relieved himself onto the stones. When he finished, he shot glances at those next to him.<P>None of Kaladin's soldiers smirked. They stood steady, spears to their sides, shields on their backs.<P>The enemy army was almost finished. The field between the two forces was bare, flat slickrock, remarkably even and smooth, broken only by occasional rockbuds. It would have made a good pasture. The warm wind blew in Cenn's face, thick with the watery scents of last night's highstorm.<P>\"Dallet!\" a voice said.<P>A man walked up through the ranks, carrying a shortspear that had two leather knife sheaths strapped to the haft. The newcomer was a young man&#8212;perhaps four years older than Cenn's fifteen&#8212;but he was taller by several fingers than even Dallet. He wore the common leathers of a spearman, but under them was a pair of dark trousers. That wasn't supposed to be allowed.<P>His black Alethi hair was shoulder-length and wavy, his eyes a dark brown. He also had knots of white cord on the shoulders of his jerkin, marking him as a squadleader.<P>The thirty men around Cenn snapped to attention, raising their spears in salute. <I>This is Kaladin Stormblessed? Cenn thought incredulously. <I>This youth?<P>\"Dallet, we're soon going to have a new recruit,\" Kaladin said. He had a strong voice. \"I need you to ...\" He trailed off as he noticed Cenn.<P>\"He found his way here just a few minutes ago, sir,\" Dallet said with a smile. \"I've been gettin' him ready.\"<P>\"Well done,\" Kaladin said. \"I paid good money to get that boy away from Gare. That man's so incompetent he might as well be fighting for the other side.\"<P><I>What? Cenn thought. <I>Why would anyone pay <I>to get me?<P>\"What do you think about the field?\" Kaladin asked. Several of the other spearmen nearby raised hands to shade from the sun, scanning the rocks.<P>\"That dip next to the two boulders on the far right?\" Dallet asked.<P>Kaladin shook his head. \"Footing's too rough.\"<P>\"Aye. Perhaps it is. What about the short hill over there? Far enough to avoid the first fall, close enough to not get too far ahead.\"<P>Kaladin nodded, though Cenn couldn't see what they were looking at. \"Looks good.\"<P>\"The rest of you louts hear that?\" Dallet shouted.<P>The men raised their spears high.<P>\"Keep an eye on the new boy, Dallet,\" Kaladin said. \"He won't know the signs.\"<P>\"Of course,\" Dallet said, smiling. Smiling! How could the man smile? The enemy army was blowing horns. Did that mean they were ready? Even though Cenn had just relieved himself, he felt a trickle of urine run down his leg.<P>\"Stay firm,\" Kaladin said, then trotted down the front line to talk to the next squadleader over. Behind Cenn and the others, the dozens of ranks were still growing. The archers on the sides prepared to fire.<P>\"Don't worry, son,\" Dallet said. \"We'll be fine. Squadleader Kaladin is lucky.\"<P>The soldier on the other side of Cenn nodded. He was a lanky, red-haired Veden, with darker tan skin than the Alethi. Why was he fighting in an Alethi army? \"That's right. Kaladin, he's stormblessed, right sure he is. We only lost ...what, one man last battle?\"<P>\"But someone <I>did die,\" Cenn said.<P>Dallet shrugged. \"People always die. Our squad loses the fewest.<P>You'll see.\"<P>Kaladin finished conferring with the other squadleader, then jogged back to his team. Though he carried a shortspear&#8212;meant to be wielded one-handed with a shield in the other hand&#8212;his was a hand longer than those held by the other men.<P>\"At the ready, men!\" Dallet called. Unlike the other squadleaders, Kaladin didn't fall into rank, but stood out in front of his squad.<P>The men around Cenn shuffled, excited. The sounds were repeated through the vast army, the stillness giving way before eagerness.<P>Hundreds of feet shuffling, shields slapping, clasps clanking. Kaladin remained motionless, staring down the other army. \"Steady, men,\" he said without turning.<P>Behind, a lighteyed officer passed on horseback. \"Be ready to fight! I want their blood, men. Fight and kill!\"<P>\"Steady,\" Kaladin said again, after the man passed.<P>\"Be ready to run,\" Dallet said to Cenn.<P>\"Run? But we've been trained to march in formation! To stay in our line!\"<P>\"Sure,\" Dallet said. \"But most of the men don't have much more training than you. Those who can fight well end up getting sent to the Shattered Plains to battle the Parshendi. Kaladin's trying to get us into shape to go there, to fight for the king.\" Dallet nodded down the line.<P>\"Most of these here will break and charge; the lighteyes aren't good enough commanders to keep them in formation. So stay with us and run.\"<P>\"Should I have my shield out?\" Around Kaladin's team, the other ranks were unhooking their shields. But Kaladin's squad left their shields on their backs.<P>Before Dallet could answer, a horn blew from behind.<P>\"Go!\" Dallet said.<P>Cenn didn't have much choice. The entire army started moving in a clamor of marching boots. As Dallet had predicted, the steady march didn't last long. Some men began yelling, the roar taken up by others. Lighteyes called for them to go, run, fight. The line disintegrated.<P>As soon as that happened, Kaladin's squad broke into a dash, running out into the front at full speed. Cenn scrambled to keep up, panicked and terrified. The ground wasn't as smooth as it had seemed, and he nearly tripped on a hidden rockbud, vines withdrawn into its shell.<P>He righted himself and kept going, holding his spear in one hand, his shield clapping against his back. The distant army was in motion as well, their soldiers charging down the field. There was no semblance of a battle formation or a careful line. This wasn't anything like the training had claimed it would be.<P>Cenn didn't even know who the enemy was. A landlord was encroaching on Brightlord Amaram's territory&#8212;the land owned, ultimately, by Highprince Sadeas. It was a border skirmish, and Cenn thought it was with another Alethi princedom. Why were they fighting each other? Perhaps the king would have put a stop to it, but he was on the Shattered Plains, seeking vengeance for the murder of King Gavilar five years before.<P>The enemy had a lot of archers. Cenn's panic climbed to a peak as the first wave of arrows flew into the air. He stumbled again, itching to take out his shield. But Dallet grabbed his arm and yanked him forward.<P>Hundreds of arrows split the sky, dimming the sun. They arced and fell, dropping like skyeels upon their prey. Amaram's soldiers raised shields. But not Kaladin's squad. No shields for them.<P>Cenn screamed.<P>And the arrows slammed into the middle ranks of Amaram's army, behind him. Cenn glanced over his shoulder, still running. The arrows fell <I>behind him. Soldiers screamed, arrows broke against shields; only a few straggling arrows landed anywhere near the front ranks.<P>\"Why?\" he yelled at Dallet. \"How did you know?\"<P>\"They want the arrows to hit where the men are most crowded,\" the large man replied. \"Where they'll have the greatest chance of finding a body.\"<P>Several other groups in the van left their shields lowered, but most ran awkwardly with their shields angled up to the sky, worried about arrows that wouldn't hit them. That slowed them, and they risked getting trampled by the men behind who <I>were getting hit. Cenn itched to raise his shield anyway; it felt so wrong to run without it.<P>The second volley hit, and men screamed in pain. Kaladin's squad barreled toward the enemy soldiers, some of whom were dying to arrows from Amaram's archers. Cenn could hear the enemy soldiers bellowing war cries, could make out individual faces. Suddenly, Kaladin's squad pulled to a halt, forming a tight group. They'd reached the small incline that Kaladin and Dallet had chosen earlier.<P>Dallet grabbed Cenn and shoved him to the very center of the formation. Kaladin's men lowered spears, pulling out shields as the enemy bore down on them. The charging foe used no careful formation; they didn't keep the ranks of longspears in back and shortspears in front. They all just ran forward, yelling in a frenzy.<P>Cenn scrambled to get his shield unlatched from his back. Clashing spears rang in the air as squads engaged one another. A group of enemy spearmen rushed up to Kaladin's squad, perhaps coveting the higher ground. The three dozen attackers had some cohesion, though they weren't in as tight a formation as Kaladin's squad was.<P>The enemy seemed determined to make up for it in passion; they bellowed and screamed in fury, rushing Kaladin's line. Kaladin's team held rank, defending Cenn as if he were some lighteyes and they were his honor guard. The two forces met with a crash of metal on wood, shields slamming together. Cenn cringed back.<P>It was over in a few eyeblinks. The enemy squad pulled back, leaving two dead on the stone. Kaladin's team hadn't lost anyone. They held their bristling V formation, though one man stepped back and pulled out a bandage to wrap a thigh wound. The rest of the men closed in to fill the spot. The wounded man was hulking and thick-armed; he cursed, but the wound didn't look bad. He was on his feet in a moment, but didn't return to the place where he'd been. Instead, he moved down to one end of the V formation, a more protected spot.<P>The battlefield was chaos. The two armies mingled indistinguishably; sounds of clanging, crunching, and screaming churned in the air. Many of the squads broke apart, members rushing from one encounter to another. They moved like hunters, groups of three or four seeking lone individuals, then brutally falling on them.<P>Kaladin's team held its ground, engaging only enemy squads that got too close. Was this what a battle really was? Cenn's practice had trained him for long ranks of men, shoulder to shoulder. Not this frenzied intermixing, this brutal pandemonium. Why didn't more hold formation?<P><I>The real soldiers are all gone, Cenn thought. <I>Off fighting in a real battle at the Shattered Plains. No wonder Kaladin wants to get his squad there.<P>Spears flashed on all sides; it was difficult to tell friend from foe, despite the emblems on breastplates and colored paint on shields. The battlefield broke down into hundreds of small groups, like a thousand different wars happening at the same time.<P>After the first few exchanges, Dallet took Cenn by the shoulder and placed him in the rank at the very bottom of the V pattern. Cenn, however, was worthless. When Kaladin's team engaged enemy squads, all of his training fled him. It took everything he had to just remain there, holding his spear outward and trying to look threatening.<P>For the better part of an hour, Kaladin's squad held their small hill, working as a team, shoulder to shoulder. Kaladin often left his position at the front, rushing this way and that, banging his spear on his shield in a strange rhythm.<P><I>Those are signals, Cenn realized as Kaladin's squad moved from the V shape into a ring. With the screams of the dying and the thousands of men calling to others, it was nearly impossible to hear a single person's voice. But the sharp clang of the spear against the metal plate on Kaladin's shield was clear. Each time they changed formations, Dallet grabbed Cenn by the shoulder and steered him.<P>Kaladin's team didn't chase down stragglers. They remained on the defensive. And, while several of the men in Kaladin's team took wounds, none of them fell. Their squad was too intimidating for the smaller groups, and larger enemy units retreated after a few exchanges, seeking easier foes.<P>Eventually something changed. Kaladin turned, watching the tides of the battle with discerning brown eyes. He raised his spear and smacked his shield in a quick rhythm he hadn't used before. Dallet grabbed Cenn by the arm and pulled him away from the small hill. Why abandon it now?<P>Just then, the larger body of Amaram's force broke, the men scattering. Cenn hadn't realized how poorly the battle in this quarter had been going for his side. As Kaladin's team retreated, they passed many wounded and dying, and Cenn grew nauseated. Soldiers were sliced open, their insides spilling out.<P>He didn't have time for horror; the retreat quickly turned into a rout. Dallet cursed, and Kaladin beat his shield again. The squad changed direction, heading eastward. There, Cenn saw, a larger group of Amaram's soldiers was holding.<P>But the enemy had seen the ranks break, and that made them bold. They rushed forward in clusters, like wild axehounds hunting stray hogs. Before Kaladin's team was halfway across the field of dead and dying, a large group of enemy soldiers intercepted them. Kaladin reluctantly banged his shield; his squad slowed.<P>Cenn felt his heart begin to thump faster and faster. Nearby, a squad of Amaram's soldiers was consumed; men stumbled and fell, screaming, trying to get away. The enemies used their spears like skewers, killing men on the ground like cremlings.<P>Kaladin's men met the enemy in a crash of spears and shields. Bodies shoved on all sides, and Cenn was spun about. In the jumble of friend and foe, dying and killing, Cenn grew overwhelmed. So many men running in so many directions!<P>He panicked, scrambling for safety. A group of soldiers nearby wore Alethi uniforms. Kaladin's squad. Cenn ran for them, but when some turned toward him, Cenn was terrified to realize he didn't recognize them. This <I>wasn't Kaladin's squad, but a small group of unfamiliar soldiers holding an uneven, broken line. Wounded and terrified, they scattered as soon as an enemy squad got close.

They could scarcely be more different&#58; One, the vision-plagued brother of an assassinated king; another, a highborn young man brought low; and the third, a brilliant, yet na&iuml;ve young woman intent on fulfilling a seemingly impossible mission.

The intrigue and excitement grow steadily in this smoothly written, perfectly balanced narrative; by the end readers won't want to put it down.&#8221;&#8212;Publishers Weekly, starred review, on Elantris \nFrom the Publisher\n\n\nThis massive tome is the first of a 10-part epic fantasy series from relative newcomer Sanderson (Mistborn), best known for his efforts to complete the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. In a storm-swept world where history has dwindled into myth, self-serving aristocrats squabble over mystical weapons that render their bearers immune to mundane attacks. The ambitious scholar Shallan learns unexpected truths about the present, the virtuous aristocrat Dalinar reclaims the lost past, and the bitter and broken slave Kaladin gains unwanted power. Race-related plot themes may raise some eyebrows, and there's no hope for anything resembling a conclusion in this introductory volume, but Sanderson's fondness for misleading the reader and his talent for feeding out revelations and action scenes at just the right pace will keep epic fantasy fans intrigued and hoping for redemptive future installments. (Sept.)\nPublishers Weekly\n\n\nCenturies have passed since the Radiant Knights protected the world of Roshar from the evil of the Desolation. Their heroic deeds have long been overshadowed by stories of their betrayal, which in turn have faded into myth. The nation of Alethkar has been mired in a war to avenge the assassination of its king. The system of power used by the Radiant Knights is largely misunderstood and untapped, and yet an ancient evil stirs. Sanderson, the author of Elantris and the \"Mistborn Trilogy,\" once again creates an interesting world with a novel system of magic, but the best part of this series launch is the compelling, complex story of Dalinar, Kaladin, and Shallan as they struggle through emotional, physical, and moral challenges.Verdict Sanderson is a master of hooking the reader in the first few pages, and once again he doesn't disappoint. Fans and lovers of epoch fantasy will find the ending satisfying, yet will eagerly await the next volume. [Sanderson was the novelist chosen to complete A Memory of Light, the final volume of Robert Jordon's \"The Wheel of Time\" series.&mdash;Ed.]&mdash;William Baer, Georgia Inst. of Technology, Atlanta\nLibrary Journal\n\n\n&#9733; 2017-11-14A sweeping fantasy story set in an original and richly detailed world.Kaladin used to be a soldier. Now he's a slave, and after 10 escape attempts, he's decided he's resigned to his fate. But he can't get away from a strangely intelligent windspren&mdash;a creature that should be an ephemeral, mindless sprite&mdash;who's been following him for months and is starting to ask tough questions about why he's given up fighting for what's right. Shallan has left her sheltered home life to pursue a desperate plan to rescue her family from financial ruin. First, she must persuade the brilliant scholar-princess Jasnah to take her on as a student. From there her task only becomes more difficult. The fates of Kaladin and Shallan and thousands of others hinge on the progress of the war for the Shattered Plains, a war that the great warrior Dalinar Kholin is beginning to doubt is right, thanks to the mysterious visions that visit him whenever a highstorm comes. This tale takes place in an unusual and intricately imagined world populated by enormous crustaceans and multiple colorful civilizations and scoured by the immensely powerful highstorms. The attention to worldbuilding makes this a fantasy fan's dream, but Sanderson (The Well of Ascension, 2017, etc.) doesn't neglect his characters, giving each of them a fully realized emotional life and high personal stakes to fight for.The vast scope of this book and the main characters' compelling journeys make it an epic worthy of the name&mdash;and a real treat for fantasy fans.<BR>\nKirkus Reviews\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Gigya Changes -->\n<!-- Gigya Changes -->\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscript defer>\n$(function() {\nvar isLoggedIn = false;\nvar ratingsParams = {\ncategoryID: 'Products',\nstreamID: '1100354496', /* use Product ID for unique identifier?

A curse that could only be broken by true love&rsquo;s kiss. You&rsquo;ve heard this before, haven&rsquo;t you? The handsome prince. The happily ever after. Utter nonsense. Let me tell you, no one in Briar actually cares about what happens to its princesses. Not the way they care about their jewels and elaborate parties and charm-granting elixirs. I thought I didn&rsquo;t care, either.Until I met her.Princess Aurora. The last heir to Briar&rsquo;s throne. Kind. Gracious. The future queen her realm needs. One who isn&rsquo;t bothered that I am Alyce, the Dark Grace, abhorred and feared for the mysterious dark magic that runs in my veins. Humiliated and shamed by the same nobles who pay me to bottle hexes and then brand me a monster. Aurora says I should be proud of my gifts. That she . . . cares for me. Even though a power like mine was responsible for her curse.But with less than a year until that curse will kill her, any future I might see with Aurora is swiftly disintegrating&mdash;and she can&rsquo;t stand to kiss yet another insipid prince. I want to help her. If my power began her curse, perhaps it&rsquo;s what can lift it. Perhaps together we could forge a new world.Nonsense again. Because we all know how this story ends, don&rsquo;t we? Aurora is the beautiful princess. And I&mdash;I am the villain.Book One of the Malice Duology",

He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal-an experience that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe.A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.",

        "description": "An unforgettable memoir about a young girl who, kept out of school, leaves her survivalist family and goes on to earn a PhD from Cambridge UniversityTara Westover was seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her \"head-for-the-hills\" bag. In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged metal in her father's junkyard.Her father distrusted the medical establishment, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when an older brother became violent.When another brother got himself into college and came back with news of the world beyond the mountain, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. She taught herself enough mathematics, grammar, and science to take the ACT and was admitted to Brigham Young University. There, she studied psychology, politics, philosophy, and history, learning for the first time about pivotal world events like the Holocaust and the Civil Rights Movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty, and of the grief that comes from severing one's closest ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes, and the will to change it.",

The peaceful protests turned violent when military police shot live ammunition into the crowd, killing over a hundred civilians.I Will Die in a Foreign Land follows four individuals over the course of a volatile Ukrainian winter, as their lives are forever changed by the Euromaidan protests. Katya is an Ukrainian-American doctor stationed at a makeshift medical clinic in St. Michael&#8217;s Monastery; Misha is an engineer originally from Pripyat, who has lived in Kyiv since his wife&#8217;s death; Slava is a fiery young activist whose past hardships steel her determination in the face of persecution; and Aleksandr Ivanovich, a former KGB agent, who climbs atop a burned-out police bus at Independence Square and plays the piano.As Katya, Misha, Slava, and Aleksandr&#8217;s lives become intertwined, they each seek their own solace during an especially tumultuous and violent period. The story is also told by a chorus of voices that incorporates folklore and narrates a turbulent Slavic history.While unfolding an especially moving story of quiet beauty and love in a time of terror, I Will Die in a Foreign Land is an ambitious, intimate, and haunting portrait of human perseverance and empathy.&#34;Kalani Pickhart's timely debut novel, I Will Die In a Foreign Land, is about the 2014 Ukrainian revolution which provided a pretense for Russia to annex Crimea.&#160;The story follows the experiences of several characters whose lives intersect as the country's political situation deteriorates.

This is the path I took to finding my purpose but also my voice in a world that didn't always see me.As I wrote Finding Me, my eyes were open to the truth of how our stories are often not given close examination. We are forced to reinvent them to fit into a crazy, competitive, judgmental world. So I wrote this for anyone running through life untethered, desperate and clawing their way through murky memories, trying to get to some form of self-love. For anyone who needs reminding that a life worth living can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you.Finding Me is a deep reflection, a promise, and a love letter of sorts to self.

When her twenty-two-year-old stepdaughter announces her engagement to her pandemic boyfriend, Sarah Danhauser is shocked. But the wheels are in motion. Headstrong Ruby has already set a date (just three months away!) and spoken to her beloved safta, Sarah's mother Veronica, about having the wedding at the family's beach house in Cape Cod. Sarah might be worried, but Veronica is thrilled to be bringing the family together one last time before putting the big house on the market. But the road to a wedding day usually comes with a few bumps. Ruby has always known exactly what she wants, but as the wedding date approaches, she finds herself grappling with the wounds left by the mother who walked out when she was a baby. Veronica ends up facing unexpected news, thanks to her meddling sister, and must revisit the choices she made long ago, when she was a bestselling novelist with a different life. Sarah's twin brother, Sam, is recovering from a terrible loss, and confronting big questions about who he is-questions he hopes to resolve during his stay on the Cape. Sarah's husband, Eli, who's been inexplicably distant during the pandemic, confronts the consequences of a long ago lapse from his typical good-guy behavior. And Sarah, frustrated by her husband, concerned about her stepdaughter, and worn out by challenges of life during quarantine, faces the alluring reappearance of someone from her past and a life that could have been. When the wedding day arrives, lovers are revealed as their true selves, misunderstandings take on a life of their own, and secrets come to light. There are confrontations and revelations that will touch each member of the extended family, ensuring that nothing will ever be the same. From “the undisputed boss of the beach read” (The New York Times), The Summer Place is a testament to family in all its messy glory; a story about what we sacrifice and how we forgive. Enthralling, witty, big-hearted, and sharply observed, this is Jennifer Weiner's love letter to the Outer Cape and the power of home, the way our lives are enriched by the people we call family, and the endless ways love can surprise us.",

But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.With unforgettably vivid characters and mesmerizing language, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world.",

When she's named the new general manager of the Hotel Nantucket, a once Gilded Age gem turned abandoned eyesore, she hopes that her local expertise and charismatic staff can win the favor of their new London billionaire owner, Xavier Darling, as well as that of Shelly Carpenter, the wildly popular Instagram tastemaker who can help put them back on the map. And while the Hotel Nantucket appears to be a blissful paradise, complete with a celebrity chef-run restaurant and an idyllic wellness center, there's a lot of drama behind closed doors. The staff (and guests) have complicated pasts, and the hotel can't seem to overcome the bad reputation it earned in 1922 when a tragic fire killed nineteen-year-old chambermaid Grace Hadley. With Grace gleefully haunting the halls, a staff harboring all kinds of secrets, and Lizbet's own romantic uncertainty, is the Hotel Nantucket destined for success or doom?  <BR /><BR />Filled with the emotional depth and multiple points of view that characterize Hilderbrand's novels (<I>The Blue Bistro, Golden Girl) as well as an added dash of Roaring Twenties history, <I>The Hotel Nantucket offers something for everyone in this compelling summer drama.",

Think page-turner.”-GlamourIn development as a major motion picture produced by and starring Florence Pugh Molly Gray is not like everyone else. She struggles with social skills and misreads the intentions of others. Her gran used to interpret the world for her, codifying it into simple rules that Molly could live by. Since Gran died a few months ago, twenty-five-year-old Molly has been navigating life's complexities all by herself. No matter-she throws herself with gusto into her work as a hotel maid. Her unique character, along with her obsessive love of cleaning and proper etiquette, make her an ideal fit for the job. She delights in donning her crisp uniform each morning, stocking her cart with miniature soaps and bottles, and returning guest rooms at the Regency Grand Hotel to a state of perfection. But Molly's orderly life is upended the day she enters the suite of the infamous and wealthy Charles Black, only to find it in a state of disarray and Mr. Black himself dead in his bed. Before she knows what's happening, Molly's unusual demeanor has the police targeting her as their lead suspect. She quickly finds herself caught in a web of deception, one she has no idea how to untangle. Fortunately for Molly, friends she never knew she had unite with her in a search for clues to what really happened to Mr. Black-but will they be able to find the real killer before it's too late? A Clue-like, locked-room mystery and a heartwarming journey of the spirit, The Maid explores what it means to be the same as everyone else and yet entirely different-and reveals that all mysteries can be solved through connection to the human heart.",

He's been an altar boy, a bartender, a fat kid, a smuggler, a biker, a prince of New England. But before all that, he was a bomb that exploded his parents' lives-or so he was told. In Dirtbag, Massachusetts, Fitzgerald, with warmth and humor, recounts his ongoing search for forgiveness, a more far-reaching vision of masculinity, and a more expansive definition of family and self.Fitzgerald's memoir-in-essays begins with a childhood that moves at breakneck speed from safety to violence, recounting an extraordinary pilgrimage through trauma to self-understanding and, ultimately, acceptance. From growing up in a Boston homeless shelter to bartending in San Francisco, from smuggling medical supplies into Burma to his lifelong struggle to make peace with his body, Fitzgerald strives to take control of his own story: one that aims to put aside anger, isolation, and entitlement to embrace the idea that one can be generous to oneself by being generous to others.Gritty and clear-eyed, loud-hearted and beautiful, Dirtbag, Massachusetts is a rollicking book that might also be a lifeline.",

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.Learn how to:Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;Design your environment to make success easier;Get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits—whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif(typeof performance.mark !== 'undefined')\nperformance.mark(\"Product_Tabs_loading_start\");\n\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Starts -->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10391,Starts-->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10391,Ends-->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Ends-->\n\n\nRelated collections and offers\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nFor Your TBL (To Be Listened) List\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nTop Selling Audiobooks\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nThe Best Books to Listen to Now\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nBuy One, Get One 50% Off Audiobooks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nli hidden>\nProduct Details\nRelated Subjects\nRead an Excerpt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\n\nFrom the Publisher\nWall Street Journal bestsellerUSA Today bestsellerPublisher's Weekly bestsellerOne of Fast Company's 7 Best Business Books of 2018One of Business Insider's Best Self-Help Books of 2018\"A supremely practical and useful book.

        "description": "From Taylor Jenkins Reid, \"a genius when it comes to stories about life and love\" (Redbook), comes an unforgettable and sweeping novel about one classic film actress's relentless rise to the top—the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn's Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn's life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn's story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. Written with Reid's signature talent for \"creating complex, likable characters\" (Real Simple), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.",

Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia to be raised in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. \"The best of all the Greeks\"-strong, beautiful, and the child of a goddess-Achilles is everything the shamed Patroclus is not. Yet despite their differences, the boys become steadfast companions. Their bond deepens as they grow into young men and become skilled in the arts of war and medicine-much to the displeasure and the fury of Achilles' mother, Thetis, a cruel sea goddess with a hatred of mortals.When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece, bound by blood and oath, must lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.Built on the groundwork of the Iliad, Madeline Miller's page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career.

This is the path I took to finding my purpose but also my voice in a world that didn't always see me.As I wrote Finding Me, my eyes were open to the truth of how our stories are often not given close examination. We are forced to reinvent them to fit into a crazy, competitive, judgmental world. So I wrote this for anyone running through life untethered, desperate and clawing their way through murky memories, trying to get to some form of self-love. For anyone who needs reminding that a life worth living can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you.Finding Me is a deep reflection, a promise, and a love letter of sorts to self. My hope is that my story will inspire you to light up your own life with creative expression and rediscover who you were before the world put a label on you.",

And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other. Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.",

Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming... Nora Stephens' life is books-she's read them all-and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters' trip away-with visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she's convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they've met many times and it's never been cute. If Nora knows she's not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he's nobody's hero, but as they are thrown together again and again-in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow-what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they've written about themselves.",

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<P>It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain&#58; mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.<P>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<P>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<P>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar&#8217;s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan&#8217;s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<P>The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<P>Speak again the ancient oaths,<P>Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.<P>and return to men the Shards they once bore.<P>The Knights Radiant must stand again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif(typeof performance.mark !== 'undefined')\nperformance.mark(\"Product_Tabs_loading_start\");\n\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Starts -->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10391,Starts-->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10391,Ends-->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Ends-->\n\n\nRelated collections and offers\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\n#BookTok: The Most Popular Books on TikTok\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nBookTok Challenge — Suspense\n\n<!-- ATG-23625 Starts For Check Mark -->\n\n\n\n\nBuy One, Get One 50% Off Books for All Ages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Starts -->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Ends -->\nAbout the Author\nRead an Excerpt\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\n\n<!-- changes start for ATG-9471 -->\n\nISBN-13:\n<!-- changes End for ATG-9471 -->\n9780765376671\n\n\nPublisher:\n\nTom Doherty Associates\n\n\n Publication date:\n03/04/2014\n\nSeries:\n\nStormlight Archive Series\n, #1\n\nEdition description:\nReprint\n\n Pages:\n1008\n\nSales rank:\n1,374\n\nProduct dimensions:\n 6.10(w) x 9.20(h) x 1.80(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Starts -->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Ends -->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Starts -->\n<!-- Code Change For ATG-10237,Ends -->\n\nAbout the Author\n\n<!-- ATG-10370 : Adding header after empty check for image-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- ATG-10370 : Adding header after empty check for content and image-->\n\n\n<P>Brandon Sanderson grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska.

While the sun is still hot, I die!\"<P>&#8212;Collected on the fifth day of the week Chach of the month Betab of the year 1171, ten seconds before death. Subject was a darkeyed soldier thirty-one years of age. Sample is considered questionable.<P>FIVE YEARS LATER<P>\"I'm going to die, aren't I?\" Cenn asked.<P>The weathered veteran beside Cenn turned and inspected him. The veteran wore a full beard, cut short. At the sides, the black hairs were starting to give way to grey.<P><I>I'm going to die, Cenn thought, clutching his spear&#8212;the shaft slick with sweat. <I>I'm going to die. Oh, Stormfather. I'm going to die....<P>\"How old are you, son?\" the veteran asked. Cenn didn't remember the man's name. It was hard to recall anything while watching that other army form lines across the rocky battlefield. That lining up seemed so civil. Neat, organized. Shortspears in the front ranks, longspears and javelins next, archers at the sides. The darkeyed spearmen wore equipment like Cenn's&#58; leather jerkin and knee-length skirt with a simple steel cap and a matching breastplate.<P>Many of the lighteyes had full suits of armor. They sat astride horses, their honor guards clustering around them with breastplates that gleamed burgundy and deep forest green. Were there Shardbearers among them? Brightlord Amaram wasn't a Shardbearer. Were any of his men? What if Cenn had to fight one? Ordinary men didn't kill Shardbearers. It had happened so infrequently that each occurrence was now legendary.<P><I>It's really happening, he thought with mounting terror. This wasn't a drill in the camp. This wasn't training out in the fields, swinging sticks. This was <I>real. Facing that fact&#8212;his heart pounding like a frightened animal in his chest, his legs unsteady&#8212;Cenn suddenly realized that he was a coward. He shouldn't have left the herds! He should never have&#8212;<P>\"Son?\" the veteran said, voice firm. \"How old are you?\"<P>\"Fifteen, sir.\"<P>\"And what's your name?\"<P>\"Cenn, sir.\"<P>The mountainous, bearded man nodded. \"I'm Dallet.\"<P>\"Dallet,\" Cenn repeated, still staring out at the other army. There were so many of them! Thousands. \"I'm going to die, aren't I?\"<P>\"<I>No.\" Dallet had a gruff voice, but somehow that was comforting. \"You're going to be just fine. Keep your head on straight.<P>Stay with the squad.\"<P>\"But I've barely had three months' training!\" He swore he could hear faint clangs from the enemy's armor or shields. \"I can barely hold this spear! Stormfather, I'm <I>dead. I can't&#8212;\"<P>\"Son,\" Dallet interrupted, soft but firm. He raised a hand and placed it on Cenn's shoulder. The rim of Dallet's large round shield reflected the light from where it hung on his back. \"You are <I>going to be <I>fine.\"<P>\"How can you know?\" It came out as a plea.<P>\"Because, lad. You're in Kaladin Stormblessed's squad.\" The other soldiers nearby nodded in agreement.<P>Behind them, waves and waves of soldiers were lining up&#8212;thousands of them. Cenn was right at the front, with Kaladin's squad of about thirty other men. Why had Cenn been moved to a new squad at the last moment? It had something to do with camp politics.<P>Why was this squad at the very front, where casualties were bound to be the greatest? Small fearspren&#8212;like globs of purplish goo&#8212;began to climb up out of the ground and gather around his feet. In a moment of sheer panic, he nearly dropped his spear and scrambled away. Dallet's hand tightened on his shoulder. Looking up into Dallet's confident black eyes, Cenn hesitated.<P>\"Did you piss before we formed ranks?\" Dallet asked.<P>\"I didn't have time to&#8212;\"<P>\"Go now.\"<P>\"<I>Here?\"<P>\"If you don't, you'll end up with it running down your leg in battle, distracting you, maybe killing you. Do it.\"<P>Embarrassed, Cenn handed Dallet his spear and relieved himself onto the stones. When he finished, he shot glances at those next to him.<P>None of Kaladin's soldiers smirked. They stood steady, spears to their sides, shields on their backs.<P>The enemy army was almost finished. The field between the two forces was bare, flat slickrock, remarkably even and smooth, broken only by occasional rockbuds. It would have made a good pasture. The warm wind blew in Cenn's face, thick with the watery scents of last night's highstorm.<P>\"Dallet!\" a voice said.<P>A man walked up through the ranks, carrying a shortspear that had two leather knife sheaths strapped to the haft. The newcomer was a young man&#8212;perhaps four years older than Cenn's fifteen&#8212;but he was taller by several fingers than even Dallet. He wore the common leathers of a spearman, but under them was a pair of dark trousers. That wasn't supposed to be allowed.<P>His black Alethi hair was shoulder-length and wavy, his eyes a dark brown. He also had knots of white cord on the shoulders of his jerkin, marking him as a squadleader.<P>The thirty men around Cenn snapped to attention, raising their spears in salute. <I>This is Kaladin Stormblessed? Cenn thought incredulously. <I>This youth?<P>\"Dallet, we're soon going to have a new recruit,\" Kaladin said. He had a strong voice. \"I need you to ...\" He trailed off as he noticed Cenn.<P>\"He found his way here just a few minutes ago, sir,\" Dallet said with a smile. \"I've been gettin' him ready.\"<P>\"Well done,\" Kaladin said. \"I paid good money to get that boy away from Gare. That man's so incompetent he might as well be fighting for the other side.\"<P><I>What? Cenn thought. <I>Why would anyone pay <I>to get me?<P>\"What do you think about the field?\" Kaladin asked. Several of the other spearmen nearby raised hands to shade from the sun, scanning the rocks.<P>\"That dip next to the two boulders on the far right?\" Dallet asked.<P>Kaladin shook his head. \"Footing's too rough.\"<P>\"Aye. Perhaps it is. What about the short hill over there? Far enough to avoid the first fall, close enough to not get too far ahead.\"<P>Kaladin nodded, though Cenn couldn't see what they were looking at. \"Looks good.\"<P>\"The rest of you louts hear that?\" Dallet shouted.<P>The men raised their spears high.<P>\"Keep an eye on the new boy, Dallet,\" Kaladin said. \"He won't know the signs.\"<P>\"Of course,\" Dallet said, smiling. Smiling! How could the man smile? The enemy army was blowing horns. Did that mean they were ready? Even though Cenn had just relieved himself, he felt a trickle of urine run down his leg.<P>\"Stay firm,\" Kaladin said, then trotted down the front line to talk to the next squadleader over. Behind Cenn and the others, the dozens of ranks were still growing. The archers on the sides prepared to fire.<P>\"Don't worry, son,\" Dallet said. \"We'll be fine. Squadleader Kaladin is lucky.\"<P>The soldier on the other side of Cenn nodded. He was a lanky, red-haired Veden, with darker tan skin than the Alethi. Why was he fighting in an Alethi army? \"That's right. Kaladin, he's stormblessed, right sure he is. We only lost ...what, one man last battle?\"<P>\"But someone <I>did die,\" Cenn said.<P>Dallet shrugged. \"People always die. Our squad loses the fewest.<P>You'll see.\"<P>Kaladin finished conferring with the other squadleader, then jogged back to his team. Though he carried a shortspear&#8212;meant to be wielded one-handed with a shield in the other hand&#8212;his was a hand longer than those held by the other men.<P>\"At the ready, men!\" Dallet called. Unlike the other squadleaders, Kaladin didn't fall into rank, but stood out in front of his squad.<P>The men around Cenn shuffled, excited. The sounds were repeated through the vast army, the stillness giving way before eagerness.<P>Hundreds of feet shuffling, shields slapping, clasps clanking. Kaladin remained motionless, staring down the other army. \"Steady, men,\" he said without turning.<P>Behind, a lighteyed officer passed on horseback. \"Be ready to fight! I want their blood, men. Fight and kill!\"<P>\"Steady,\" Kaladin said again, after the man passed.<P>\"Be ready to run,\" Dallet said to Cenn.<P>\"Run? But we've been trained to march in formation! To stay in our line!\"<P>\"Sure,\" Dallet said. \"But most of the men don't have much more training than you. Those who can fight well end up getting sent to the Shattered Plains to battle the Parshendi. Kaladin's trying to get us into shape to go there, to fight for the king.\" Dallet nodded down the line.<P>\"Most of these here will break and charge; the lighteyes aren't good enough commanders to keep them in formation. So stay with us and run.\"<P>\"Should I have my shield out?\" Around Kaladin's team, the other ranks were unhooking their shields. But Kaladin's squad left their shields on their backs.<P>Before Dallet could answer, a horn blew from behind.<P>\"Go!\" Dallet said.<P>Cenn didn't have much choice. The entire army started moving in a clamor of marching boots. As Dallet had predicted, the steady march didn't last long. Some men began yelling, the roar taken up by others. Lighteyes called for them to go, run, fight. The line disintegrated.<P>As soon as that happened, Kaladin's squad broke into a dash, running out into the front at full speed. Cenn scrambled to keep up, panicked and terrified. The ground wasn't as smooth as it had seemed, and he nearly tripped on a hidden rockbud, vines withdrawn into its shell.<P>He righted himself and kept going, holding his spear in one hand, his shield clapping against his back. The distant army was in motion as well, their soldiers charging down the field. There was no semblance of a battle formation or a careful line. This wasn't anything like the training had claimed it would be.<P>Cenn didn't even know who the enemy was. A landlord was encroaching on Brightlord Amaram's territory&#8212;the land owned, ultimately, by Highprince Sadeas. It was a border skirmish, and Cenn thought it was with another Alethi princedom. Why were they fighting each other? Perhaps the king would have put a stop to it, but he was on the Shattered Plains, seeking vengeance for the murder of King Gavilar five years before.<P>The enemy had a lot of archers. Cenn's panic climbed to a peak as the first wave of arrows flew into the air. He stumbled again, itching to take out his shield. But Dallet grabbed his arm and yanked him forward.<P>Hundreds of arrows split the sky, dimming the sun. They arced and fell, dropping like skyeels upon their prey. Amaram's soldiers raised shields. But not Kaladin's squad. No shields for them.<P>Cenn screamed.<P>And the arrows slammed into the middle ranks of Amaram's army, behind him. Cenn glanced over his shoulder, still running. The arrows fell <I>behind him. Soldiers screamed, arrows broke against shields; only a few straggling arrows landed anywhere near the front ranks.<P>\"Why?\" he yelled at Dallet. \"How did you know?\"<P>\"They want the arrows to hit where the men are most crowded,\" the large man replied. \"Where they'll have the greatest chance of finding a body.\"<P>Several other groups in the van left their shields lowered, but most ran awkwardly with their shields angled up to the sky, worried about arrows that wouldn't hit them. That slowed them, and they risked getting trampled by the men behind who <I>were getting hit. Cenn itched to raise his shield anyway; it felt so wrong to run without it.<P>The second volley hit, and men screamed in pain. Kaladin's squad barreled toward the enemy soldiers, some of whom were dying to arrows from Amaram's archers. Cenn could hear the enemy soldiers bellowing war cries, could make out individual faces. Suddenly, Kaladin's squad pulled to a halt, forming a tight group. They'd reached the small incline that Kaladin and Dallet had chosen earlier.<P>Dallet grabbed Cenn and shoved him to the very center of the formation. Kaladin's men lowered spears, pulling out shields as the enemy bore down on them. The charging foe used no careful formation; they didn't keep the ranks of longspears in back and shortspears in front. They all just ran forward, yelling in a frenzy.<P>Cenn scrambled to get his shield unlatched from his back. Clashing spears rang in the air as squads engaged one another. A group of enemy spearmen rushed up to Kaladin's squad, perhaps coveting the higher ground. The three dozen attackers had some cohesion, though they weren't in as tight a formation as Kaladin's squad was.<P>The enemy seemed determined to make up for it in passion; they bellowed and screamed in fury, rushing Kaladin's line. Kaladin's team held rank, defending Cenn as if he were some lighteyes and they were his honor guard. The two forces met with a crash of metal on wood, shields slamming together. Cenn cringed back.<P>It was over in a few eyeblinks. The enemy squad pulled back, leaving two dead on the stone. Kaladin's team hadn't lost anyone. They held their bristling V formation, though one man stepped back and pulled out a bandage to wrap a thigh wound. The rest of the men closed in to fill the spot. The wounded man was hulking and thick-armed; he cursed, but the wound didn't look bad. He was on his feet in a moment, but didn't return to the place where he'd been. Instead, he moved down to one end of the V formation, a more protected spot.<P>The battlefield was chaos. The two armies mingled indistinguishably; sounds of clanging, crunching, and screaming churned in the air. Many of the squads broke apart, members rushing from one encounter to another. They moved like hunters, groups of three or four seeking lone individuals, then brutally falling on them.<P>Kaladin's team held its ground, engaging only enemy squads that got too close. Was this what a battle really was? Cenn's practice had trained him for long ranks of men, shoulder to shoulder. Not this frenzied intermixing, this brutal pandemonium. Why didn't more hold formation?<P><I>The real soldiers are all gone, Cenn thought. <I>Off fighting in a real battle at the Shattered Plains. No wonder Kaladin wants to get his squad there.<P>Spears flashed on all sides; it was difficult to tell friend from foe, despite the emblems on breastplates and colored paint on shields. The battlefield broke down into hundreds of small groups, like a thousand different wars happening at the same time.<P>After the first few exchanges, Dallet took Cenn by the shoulder and placed him in the rank at the very bottom of the V pattern. Cenn, however, was worthless. When Kaladin's team engaged enemy squads, all of his training fled him. It took everything he had to just remain there, holding his spear outward and trying to look threatening.<P>For the better part of an hour, Kaladin's squad held their small hill, working as a team, shoulder to shoulder. Kaladin often left his position at the front, rushing this way and that, banging his spear on his shield in a strange rhythm.<P><I>Those are signals, Cenn realized as Kaladin's squad moved from the V shape into a ring. With the screams of the dying and the thousands of men calling to others, it was nearly impossible to hear a single person's voice. But the sharp clang of the spear against the metal plate on Kaladin's shield was clear. Each time they changed formations, Dallet grabbed Cenn by the shoulder and steered him.<P>Kaladin's team didn't chase down stragglers. They remained on the defensive. And, while several of the men in Kaladin's team took wounds, none of them fell. Their squad was too intimidating for the smaller groups, and larger enemy units retreated after a few exchanges, seeking easier foes.<P>Eventually something changed. Kaladin turned, watching the tides of the battle with discerning brown eyes. He raised his spear and smacked his shield in a quick rhythm he hadn't used before. Dallet grabbed Cenn by the arm and pulled him away from the small hill. Why abandon it now?<P>Just then, the larger body of Amaram's force broke, the men scattering. Cenn hadn't realized how poorly the battle in this quarter had been going for his side. As Kaladin's team retreated, they passed many wounded and dying, and Cenn grew nauseated. Soldiers were sliced open, their insides spilling out.<P>He didn't have time for horror; the retreat quickly turned into a rout. Dallet cursed, and Kaladin beat his shield again. The squad changed direction, heading eastward. There, Cenn saw, a larger group of Amaram's soldiers was holding.<P>But the enemy had seen the ranks break, and that made them bold. They rushed forward in clusters, like wild axehounds hunting stray hogs. Before Kaladin's team was halfway across the field of dead and dying, a large group of enemy soldiers intercepted them. Kaladin reluctantly banged his shield; his squad slowed.<P>Cenn felt his heart begin to thump faster and faster. Nearby, a squad of Amaram's soldiers was consumed; men stumbled and fell, screaming, trying to get away. The enemies used their spears like skewers, killing men on the ground like cremlings.<P>Kaladin's men met the enemy in a crash of spears and shields. Bodies shoved on all sides, and Cenn was spun about. In the jumble of friend and foe, dying and killing, Cenn grew overwhelmed. So many men running in so many directions!<P>He panicked, scrambling for safety. A group of soldiers nearby wore Alethi uniforms. Kaladin's squad. Cenn ran for them, but when some turned toward him, Cenn was terrified to realize he didn't recognize them. This <I>wasn't Kaladin's squad, but a small group of unfamiliar soldiers holding an uneven, broken line. Wounded and terrified, they scattered as soon as an enemy squad got close.

They could scarcely be more different&#58; One, the vision-plagued brother of an assassinated king; another, a highborn young man brought low; and the third, a brilliant, yet na&iuml;ve young woman intent on fulfilling a seemingly impossible mission.

The intrigue and excitement grow steadily in this smoothly written, perfectly balanced narrative; by the end readers won't want to put it down.&#8221;&#8212;Publishers Weekly, starred review, on Elantris \nFrom the Publisher\n\n\nThis massive tome is the first of a 10-part epic fantasy series from relative newcomer Sanderson (Mistborn), best known for his efforts to complete the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. In a storm-swept world where history has dwindled into myth, self-serving aristocrats squabble over mystical weapons that render their bearers immune to mundane attacks. The ambitious scholar Shallan learns unexpected truths about the present, the virtuous aristocrat Dalinar reclaims the lost past, and the bitter and broken slave Kaladin gains unwanted power. Race-related plot themes may raise some eyebrows, and there's no hope for anything resembling a conclusion in this introductory volume, but Sanderson's fondness for misleading the reader and his talent for feeding out revelations and action scenes at just the right pace will keep epic fantasy fans intrigued and hoping for redemptive future installments. (Sept.)\nPublishers Weekly\n\n\nCenturies have passed since the Radiant Knights protected the world of Roshar from the evil of the Desolation. Their heroic deeds have long been overshadowed by stories of their betrayal, which in turn have faded into myth. The nation of Alethkar has been mired in a war to avenge the assassination of its king. The system of power used by the Radiant Knights is largely misunderstood and untapped, and yet an ancient evil stirs. Sanderson, the author of Elantris and the \"Mistborn Trilogy,\" once again creates an interesting world with a novel system of magic, but the best part of this series launch is the compelling, complex story of Dalinar, Kaladin, and Shallan as they struggle through emotional, physical, and moral challenges.Verdict Sanderson is a master of hooking the reader in the first few pages, and once again he doesn't disappoint. Fans and lovers of epoch fantasy will find the ending satisfying, yet will eagerly await the next volume. [Sanderson was the novelist chosen to complete A Memory of Light, the final volume of Robert Jordon's \"The Wheel of Time\" series.&mdash;Ed.]&mdash;William Baer, Georgia Inst. of Technology, Atlanta\nLibrary Journal\n\n\n&#9733; 2017-11-14A sweeping fantasy story set in an original and richly detailed world.Kaladin used to be a soldier. Now he's a slave, and after 10 escape attempts, he's decided he's resigned to his fate. But he can't get away from a strangely intelligent windspren&mdash;a creature that should be an ephemeral, mindless sprite&mdash;who's been following him for months and is starting to ask tough questions about why he's given up fighting for what's right. Shallan has left her sheltered home life to pursue a desperate plan to rescue her family from financial ruin. First, she must persuade the brilliant scholar-princess Jasnah to take her on as a student. From there her task only becomes more difficult. The fates of Kaladin and Shallan and thousands of others hinge on the progress of the war for the Shattered Plains, a war that the great warrior Dalinar Kholin is beginning to doubt is right, thanks to the mysterious visions that visit him whenever a highstorm comes. This tale takes place in an unusual and intricately imagined world populated by enormous crustaceans and multiple colorful civilizations and scoured by the immensely powerful highstorms. The attention to worldbuilding makes this a fantasy fan's dream, but Sanderson (The Well of Ascension, 2017, etc.) doesn't neglect his characters, giving each of them a fully realized emotional life and high personal stakes to fight for.The vast scope of this book and the main characters' compelling journeys make it an epic worthy of the name&mdash;and a real treat for fantasy fans.<BR>\nKirkus Reviews\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Gigya Changes -->\n<!-- Gigya Changes -->\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Internal Component Tracking - Begin -->\n<!-- Internal Component Tracking - End -->\n\nif(typeof performance.mark !== 'undefined')\nperformance.mark(\"BloomReach_Widget_loading_starts\");\n\n\n<!-- Related Searches -->\n\n\n\n\nsection data-modifyslick class=\"book bloomReachRelatedSearch\">\n\nRelated Searches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightbringer Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Blade Itself (First Law Trilogy #1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDragonlance - Dragons of Autumn Twili&#8230;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Argument of Kings (First Law Tri&#8230;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDragonlance - Dragons of Winter Night&#8230;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Explore More Items -->\n\n\n\n\nsection data-modifyslick class=\"mb-5 book bloomReachExploreItems\">\n\nExplore More Items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Blinding Knife (Lightbringer Series #2)\n\n<P>From the New York Times Bestselling author of The Black Prism... <P>Gavin Guile is dying. <P>He'd thought he had five years left&#151;now he has less than one.

A curse that could only be broken by true love&rsquo;s kiss. You&rsquo;ve heard this before, haven&rsquo;t you? The handsome prince. The happily ever after. Utter nonsense. Let me tell you, no one in Briar actually cares about what happens to its princesses. Not the way they care about their jewels and elaborate parties and charm-granting elixirs. I thought I didn&rsquo;t care, either.Until I met her.Princess Aurora. The last heir to Briar&rsquo;s throne. Kind. Gracious. The future queen her realm needs. One who isn&rsquo;t bothered that I am Alyce, the Dark Grace, abhorred and feared for the mysterious dark magic that runs in my veins.

        "description": "A revised and updated edition of Emily Nagoski's game-changing New York Times bestseller Come As You Are, featuring new information and research on mindfulness, desire, and pleasure that will radically transform your sex life.For much of the 20th and 21st centuries, women's sexuality was an uncharted territory in science, studied far less frequently-and far less seriously-than its male counterpart. That is, until Emily Nagoski's Come As You Are, which used groundbreaking science and research to prove that the most important factor in creating and sustaining a sex life filled with confidence and joy is not what the parts are or how they're organized but how you feel about them. In the years since the book's initial publication, countless women have learned through Nagoski's accessible and informative guide that things like stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman's sexual wellbeing; they are central to it-and that even if you don't always feel like it, you are already sexually whole by just being yourself. This revised and updated edition continues that mission with new information and advanced research, demystifying and decoding the science of sex so that everyone can create a better sex life and discover more pleasure than you ever thought possible.",

From the #1 bestselling authors Hillary Clinton and Louise Penny comes a novel of unsurpassed thrills and incomparable insider expertise-State of Terror.After a tumultuous period in American politics, a new administration has just been sworn in, and to everyone's surprise the president chooses a political enemy for the vital position of secretary of state. There is no love lost between the president of the United States and Ellen Adams, his new secretary of state. But it's a canny move on the part of the president. With this appointment, he silences one of his harshest critics, since taking the job means Adams must step down as head of her multinational media conglomerate. As the new president addresses Congress for the first time, with Secretary Adams in attendance, Anahita Dahir, a young foreign service officer (FSO) on the Pakistan desk at the State Department, receives a baffling text from an anonymous source. Too late, she realizes the message was a hastily coded warning. What begins as a series of apparent terrorist attacks is revealed to be the beginning of an international chess game involving the volatile and Byzantine politics of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran; the race to develop nuclear weapons in the region; the Russian mob; a burgeoning rogue terrorist organization; and an American government set back on its heels in the international arena. As the horrifying scale of the threat becomes clear, Secretary Adams and her team realize it has been carefully planned to take advantage of four years of an American government out of touch with international affairs, out of practice with diplomacy, and out of power in the places where it counts the most. To defeat such an intricate, carefully constructed conspiracy, it will take the skills of a unique team: a passionate young FSO; a dedicated journalist; and a smart, determined, but as yet untested new secretary of state. State of Terror is a unique and utterly compelling international thriller cowritten by Hillary Rodham Clinton, the 67th secretary of state, and Louise Penny, a multiple award-winning #1 New York Times bestselling novelist.",

Carol wasn't just Katy's mom, but her best friend and first phone call. She had all the answers and now, when Katy needs her the most, she is gone. To make matters worse, their planned mother-daughter trip of a lifetime looms: to Positano, the magical town where Carol spent the summer right before she met Katy's father. Katy has been waiting years for Carol to take her, and now she is faced with embarking on the adventure alone. But as soon as she steps foot on the Amalfi Coast, Katy begins to feel her mother's spirit. Buoyed by the stunning waters, beautiful cliffsides, delightful residents, and, of course, delectable food, Katy feels herself coming back to life. And then Carol appears-in the flesh, healthy, sun-tanned, and thirty years old. Katy doesn't understand what is happening, or how-all she can focus on is that she has somehow, impossibly, gotten her mother back. Over the course of one Italian summer, Katy gets to know Carol, not as her mother, but as the young woman before her. She is not exactly who Katy imagined she might be, however, and soon Katy must reconcile the mother who knew everything with the young woman who does not yet have a clue.

When her twenty-two-year-old stepdaughter announces her engagement to her pandemic boyfriend, Sarah Danhauser is shocked. But the wheels are in motion. Headstrong Ruby has already set a date (just three months away!) and spoken to her beloved safta, Sarah's mother Veronica, about having the wedding at the family's beach house in Cape Cod. Sarah might be worried, but Veronica is thrilled to be bringing the family together one last time before putting the big house on the market. But the road to a wedding day usually comes with a few bumps. Ruby has always known exactly what she wants, but as the wedding date approaches, she finds herself grappling with the wounds left by the mother who walked out when she was a baby. Veronica ends up facing unexpected news, thanks to her meddling sister, and must revisit the choices she made long ago, when she was a bestselling novelist with a different life. Sarah's twin brother, Sam, is recovering from a terrible loss, and confronting big questions about who he is-questions he hopes to resolve during his stay on the Cape. Sarah's husband, Eli, who's been inexplicably distant during the pandemic, confronts the consequences of a long ago lapse from his typical good-guy behavior. And Sarah, frustrated by her husband, concerned about her stepdaughter, and worn out by challenges of life during quarantine, faces the alluring reappearance of someone from her past and a life that could have been. When the wedding day arrives, lovers are revealed as their true selves, misunderstandings take on a life of their own, and secrets come to light. There are confrontations and revelations that will touch each member of the extended family, ensuring that nothing will ever be the same. From “the undisputed boss of the beach read” (The New York Times), The Summer Place is a testament to family in all its messy glory; a story about what we sacrifice and how we forgive. Enthralling, witty, big-hearted, and sharply observed, this is Jennifer Weiner's love letter to the Outer Cape and the power of home, the way our lives are enriched by the people we call family, and the endless ways love can surprise us.",

More specif­ically, there could never be “another Diana”-a mem­ber of the family whose global popularity upstaged, outshone, and posed an existential threat to the Brit­ish monarchy.Picking up where Tina Brown's masterful The Diana Chronicles left off, The Palace Papers reveals how the royal family reinvented itself after the trau­matic years when Diana's blazing celebrity ripped through the House of Windsor like a comet.Brown takes readers on a tour de force journey through the scandals, love affairs, power plays, and betrayals that have buffeted the monarchy over the last twenty-five years. We see the Queen's stoic re­solve after the passing of Princess Margaret, the Queen Mother, and Prince Philip, her partner for seven decades, and how she triumphs in her Jubilee years even as family troubles rage around her. Brown explores Prince Charles's determination to make Camilla Parker Bowles his wife, the tension between William and Harry on “different paths,” the ascend­ance of Kate Middleton, the downfall of Prince An­drew, and Harry and Meghan's stunning decision to step back as senior royals. Despite the fragile monar­chy's best efforts, “never again” seems fast approaching.Tina Brown has been observing and chronicling the British monarchy for three decades, and her sweeping account is full of powerful revelations, newly reported details, and searing insight gleaned from remarkable access to royal insiders.
